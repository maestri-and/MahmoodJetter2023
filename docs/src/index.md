# MahmoodJetter2023

`MahmoodJetter2023` is a Julia package designed to replicate the results presented in Mahmood & Jetter (2023). It offers a comprehensive suite of functions to streamline data preparation, generate tables and figures, and execute high-level replication tasks.

The package is organized into four main submodules:

- **WranglingFuns**: Contains functions for importing, cleaning, and preprocessing data, including handling missing values, variable transformations, and creating moving averages.
- **TablesFuns**: Provides tools to replicate summary statistics and regression tables, such as Table 1 and Table 2, from Mahmood & Jetter (2023). It supports generating LaTeX and plain text tables.
- **FiguresFuns**: Focuses on generating visualizations, including binscatter plots, regression figures, and publication-ready figures for the study.
- **RunningFuns**: The high-level module that executes the core replication process, including data cleaning and running the main analysis scripts to replicate the results of the study.

## Modules
